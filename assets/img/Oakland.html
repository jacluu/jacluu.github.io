					Oakland's Chinatown was first settled by Chinese immigrant gold miners in the 1800s. The earliest records of Chinese residents in Oakland date back to 1840, where laborers were employed in the Redwood Oaks Groves in the Oakland hills in the timber trade. Many others worked as sharecroppers, given legal regulations preventing Chinese settlers from owning land, By 1860, around 200 of Oakland's population of 1500 were of Chinese ethnicity
